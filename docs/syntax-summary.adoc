= Syntax Summary

:microsoft: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/c-language-syntax-summary?view=msvc-170

As Sea is based on C and Python, most of Sea's grammar is based directly on C.
Specifically, I utilized {microsoft}[Microsoft's C Language Syntax Summary] to construct this document.

|*Attribute*

|Italic text is for nonterminals.

|Bold is for literal keywords and symbols.

|_optional_~opt~
|Nonterminals followed by ~opt~ are optional.

|*(*~opt~ _mutually optional_ *)*~opt~
|With surrounding optional brackets, the brackets must both be included, or must both not be included.

A colon following a nonterminal begins its definition.
Definitions can be recursive.
Each new line is an alternative definition, unless prefaced by "one of".
